The office currently has a wireless network, although almost all of the machines use a wired connection.</p><p>My current task is to get a connection out to everyone. One option is to buy a wireless card for every machine, but this won't work in the long run because each workstation also has an IP phone which uses a wired connection. Instead of getting wireless cards for each machine as well as replace all of the IP phones with wireless versions. A <a
title="Wireless bridge on Wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wireless_bridge" target="_blank">wireless bridge</a> seems to fit the bill nicely. Both the computer and phone can connect and if workstations are close enough together, they can share a wireless bridge. The less devices to buy, the better.</p><p>This effectively creates a network drop that doesn't need wires running through the wall to use it. I am also able to keep the WPA settings on the device itself and not have to have the computers themselves managing the connection.</p><p>I went out looking a different products starting with these requirements.</p><ul><li>802.11n - Our wireless network supports 802.11n, so I'll want the bridge to as well, so the wireless doesn't bottleneck the speed as much as possible</li><li>Gigabit ethernet</li><li>4 wired ethernet ports - allows 2 workstations (2 computers and 2 phones) without the need of extra switches</li></li><li>WPA2 encryption - most support this these days, but it is still a requirement.</li></li></ul><p>I was able to find 2 devices that fit the bill nicely.</p><ul><li><a
