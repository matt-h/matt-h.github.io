I had heard a lot of great thing about this book. I hadn't even heard of it until I heard the second book came out and everyone was talking about how excited they were to get it. Now that I'm done with this one, I really want to read the next book. That will be soon.</p><p><em>Warning</em> This may be considered as spoilers.</p><p>Overall, I loved the book. I love the chronological method it is told in, and it starts from the very beginning of Kvothe's life. You don't miss out on anything that happened, and you get to see what events turned him into the person he is.  This is only the first part, so I don't know everything that will happen yet, but what has happened so far as been both interestin g and exciting. Rothfuss does a great job in transitioning the mood from Kvothe's time with his parents, to their death, to his living on the streets, and then studying at the University.</p><p>I go back and forth on whether or not I like the interlude parts in the tavern. They do belong in the book and definitely add to it, since you are listening right along to the telling of his life story, but I found some of it to be hard to get through and I wanted to get right back into the story. I guess I will have to wait and see where those parts lead to in the next books before I decide if it would have better told with or without those.</p></div><footer
