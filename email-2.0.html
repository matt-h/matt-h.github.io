Since you already have the method of retrieving public keys from mail servers and and all users must have private keys to sign the messages, it is easy enough just to encrypt the message as well.</p><h1>Pros</h1><p>Spoofed mail is history.</p><ul><li>All email that is sent must be signed with the users private key or it is not delivered.</li></ul><p>Clients can send mail directly</p><ul><li>Mail clients can do all of the connection to the remote server without having to relay through their own server.</li><li>It is still possible to have the server send, it would just need a copy of the public key, or the email should be pre-signed.</li></ul><p>No more IP blacklisting</p><ul><li>All mail can only be sent by being signed by a private key that can be verified as coming from that domain</li><li>Either the email address or domain can be blocked for spam instead</li></ul><h1>Cons</h1><p>Not backwards compatable</p><ul><li>The requirment that all messages must be signed, makes it so all servers and clients must be updated</li><li>However, servers and clients can have a fallback<ul><li>Clients with Email 2.0 connecting to an email server can test if it supports email 2.0<ul><li>If it does not, the client should fallback to old methods.</li></ul></li><li>Servers with Email 2.0 can optionally choose to support mail coming from current methods and treat it as it currently does.</li></ul></li></ul><h1>Encryption</h1><p>All encryption and signing is done with asymmetric keypairs. A standard will need to be decidied on of what method to use.</p></div>
